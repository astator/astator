# astator
Python Intelligent Aide for Humans

# History

Although there has been several attempts in making the machines clever, the early prototypes were still dumb. It was until 2015, with the creation of first type of astator…

# Introduction

Astator, aims to help humans by trying to understand them and answer their questions. They do not aim harm, they are here to help. But who knows, they might one day overthrow humans and rule the world, that I do not know.

# Overview

The engine is written in Python. There is also a [Django interface](https://github.com/semihyagcioglu/advocatus) in the development, but you can use Astator standalone as a Python package.

The first prototype of astator will be simple. They will parse the query, gather information, evaluate findings and answer your question.

# Goal

I just want to have some fun, and see what this prototype can do.

# Installation

```pip install git+git://github.com/astator/astator.git```

or

```pip install git+https://github.com/astator/astator.git```

or without git

```pip install —upgrade https://github.com/astator/astator/tarball/master```


# Ideas

- Add wikipedia as knowledge base.  maybe simple english?
- Write some core classes
- Cosine similarity. genesis might be good for this.
- Planning to add CI and deployment to a production server, so that I can play with it anytime I want.

# Roadmap

There are several ways to improve astator. Please let me know, if you have suggestions. Or better, you can just contribute by just sending a pull request.
